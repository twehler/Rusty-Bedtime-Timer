# Rusty-Bedtime-Timer
A simple, short bedtime timer which blocks more blue light than traditional blue-filter programs, while making the screen still comfortable to look at (until bedtime is reached). Makes you very tired. Details are located in the README file. At the moment it is written for Linux only, using Rust and xsct.
